WDI Project 2: CRUD on Rails
Proposal:
Wellnyss (working name)

Users can log in each day, and are asked to assess their mental health/wellness on a scale from 1-10. Based on the input, the user is prompted to set goals, referred to resources, or log outcomes.

User Stories:
As a user I should be able to score my mental health daily to ensure I am thinking about it.
As a user I should be able to get feedback/resources based on my score to improve/maintain wellness.
As a user I should be able to record why I feel good when I feel good to tap those memories when I am not feeling good.
As a user I should  be able to set goals to focus on improving my wellness in specific, targeted ways.
As a user I should be able to sign in and out to protect my privacy.
As a user I should be able to see my self score over time to look for patterns/improvement
